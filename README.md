# Clever's Rails + Hotwire Coding Interview

Photo Gallery is a Rails + Hotwire app where signed-in users can browse seeded photos and like or unlike them without a full page reload.

## What to Look For

- Devise gates access to the gallery.
- Photos are seeded from `photos.csv` into the database.
- Likes update with Turbo Frames/Streams.
- Pagination uses Turbo Streams when the photo count exceeds the page size.
- Like counts persist with a counter cache.
- Users can only like each photo once.
- The layout is mobile responsive.

## Local Setup

This app uses:

- Ruby `3.4.2`
- Rails `8.0.5`
- SQLite
- Devise
- Hotwire
- RSpec

From the project root, run:

```bash
ruby -v
bundle install
bin/rails db:setup
```

Use Ruby `3.4.2`. If you manage Ruby versions with asdf, you can install the project version with:

```bash
asdf install
```

`db:setup` creates the database, runs migrations, and seeds:

- the demo users from `db/seeds.rb`
- the 10 photos from `photos.csv`

Seeded users:

- Email: `demo@example.com`
- Password: `password`

- Email: `demo2@example.com`
- Password: `password`

Start the app:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

If you want to reset the local database from scratch:

```bash
bin/rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## Implementation Notes

- Authentication uses Devise.
- Sign-up is intentionally not exposed; users are seeded in `db/seeds.rb`.
- Photos are imported from `photos.csv` during seeding and stored in the database.
- Likes use Rails routes/controllers with Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams.
- Like counts persist with a database-backed counter cache.
- Each user can like each photo only once, enforced by model validation and a database unique index.
- Pagination uses Pagy and updates the photo results with Turbo Streams, so when the photo set grows larger, it does not all load on one page. This keeps each request focused on the current page of records instead of loading the full gallery into memory and rendering every card at once.
- Flash message dismissal uses a small Stimulus controller.

Welcome to Clever's full-stack coding challenge. You'll build a small but complete web application using **Ruby on Rails** and **Hotwire** (Turbo + Stimulus). The goal is to assess how you think about Rails conventions, server-rendered interactivity, and clean UI without a heavy JavaScript framework.

---

## The Challenge

Build a photo gallery application where authenticated users can browse and "like" photos — all without writing a separate API or client-side SPA.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Authentication

- A sign-in page that gates access to the rest of the app
- Users who are not signed in should be redirected to sign in
- You may use any approach you prefer: `has_secure_password`, Devise, or a simple session-based system
- No sign-up flow is needed — seed one or more users directly in `db/seeds.rb`

### 2. Photo Gallery

- Display all 10 photos from the provided `photos.csv` on a single "All Photos" page
- Seed the photos into your database from the CSV — do not read the CSV at runtime
- Each photo card should show:
  - The photo image (use the `src.medium` URL)
  - The photographer's name
  - A link icon + the photo's source URL (use `links.svg`)
  - A like button with the current like count (use `star-fill.svg` and `star-line.svg`)

### 3. Like Functionality (Hotwire)

- Signed-in users can like and unlike any photo
- **Likes must update without a full page reload** — use Turbo Streams or Turbo Frames
- Like counts must persist in the database
- Each user can like a photo only once

### 4. No JavaScript Frameworks

The interactivity must be implemented with **Hotwire** (Turbo + optionally Stimulus). Do not use React, Vue, or any other JS framework.

---

## Bonus

- Mobile-responsive layout
- A Stimulus controller for any client-side behavior (e.g. optimistic UI, toggling state)
- Meaningful test coverage (RSpec or Minitest)

---

## Assets Provided

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `photos.csv` | Photo data — seed this into your database |
| `logo.svg` | Clever "Ci" logo for the nav/header |
| `links.svg` | Link icon for each photo card |
| `star-fill.svg` | Filled star — shown when a photo is liked |
| `star-line.svg` | Outline star — shown when a photo is not liked |

---

## Getting Started

There is no starter application. Create a new Rails app from scratch:

```bash
rails new photo-gallery --database=sqlite3
cd photo-gallery
```

Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) ships with Rails 7+ by default. If you're on Rails 6, add:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "hotwire-rails"
```

---

## What We're Looking For

| Area | What to demonstrate |
|------|-------------------|
| **Rails conventions** | Resourceful routing, skinny controllers, proper use of models |
| **Hotwire / Turbo** | Turbo Streams or Frames for the like feature — not polling, not custom fetch |
| **Database design** | Appropriate models, associations, and constraints |
| **HTML/CSS** | Clean, readable markup; reasonable styling without a heavy framework |
| **Code quality** | Clear naming, no unnecessary complexity, code you'd be comfortable reviewing |

---

## Time

Most candidates complete the core requirements in 2–4 hours. If you run out of time, leave notes in your README describing what you'd do next rather than rushing.

---

## Submission

1. Fork this repository
2. Build your application in the fork (the Rails app can live at the repo root or in a subdirectory)
3. Include setup instructions in your README so we can run it locally
4. Open a pull request back to this repository
5. Email your recruiter point of contact

## Design Reference

The UI doesn't need to be pixel-perfect, but aim for something clean and usable. A photo card should convey the image, photographer credit, source link, and like action clearly. Use the Clever brand color `#0075EB` where appropriate.
